Overview of the Project
This C program is a simple multiple-choice quiz game that asks the user a series of questions, provides answer choices, and tracks their score based on correct answers. It stores the questions, choices, and correct answers in arrays, and the user selects their answer by entering a number. The program checks if the answer is correct, gives feedback, and updates the score accordingly. After all questions are answered, the program displays the user's final score. The logic for asking questions and updating the score is encapsulated in a separate function, making the code modular and easy to understand.
